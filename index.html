      <h2 class="heading">Biography </h2>
      <p>
        Dr. M. Chandrasekhar has 21 years of Defense Industrial R&D experience and 11 years of Engineering Teaching
        Experience for UG & PG at Central and State Universities. He worked as a Senior Manager (R&D) in Missile
        Technology at Bharat Dynamics, Hyderabad, Ministry of Defense, Government of India. He is well-known for his
        significant contributions towards the indigenous design, development of Embedded Test Systems Deployment. His
        achievements were recognized two times for prestigious national awards, “ Excellence Award-2003 ” awarded in
        2005 for Indigenization and saving foreign exchange of 40 Crore. The second time, “Excellence Award-2005”
        awarded in 2007 for Innovation of Countermeasure defense system for Fighter Aircrafts (Developed First time in
        India). Award from Hon. President of India via defense Ministry, Government of India.
        <br><br>
        He was graduated from Osmania University Campus, in 1986, M. Sc. (Tech.) 3yr Integrated PG with “Applied
        Electronics” and a second Master’s degree, M. Tech. From the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 1994. He
        was awarded a Doctorate in “VLSI Embedded Systems” from SKU Acanthus, in 2009. He was appointed as a scientist
        in 1995, under Deportment of Atomic Energy (DAE) in Plasma Research Institute (IPR) at Ahmadabad. He resigned in
        1996 and joined as a faculty for newly started M. Sc., an Electronics program at the University of Hyderabad. He
        played a key role in establishing a newly started Master Degree Program in Electronics. He developed advanced
        Microprocessors Lab., and Applied Lasers experimental Lab. For PG Program.
        <br><br>
        He joined the BDL R&D unit in Hyderabad. Being a new R&D, he established a strong foundation for advanced
        Embedded Systems research groups to equip Armed forces with new portable, power-efficient technologies of
        interdisciplinary Systems. As a New project advisor, he significantly contributed towards the formulation of
        several sub-systems by innovative and reverse engineering approaches for ATGMs, SAMs, and HILS. His contribution
        to the development of cost-effective Realtime Hardware In Loop Simulators (HILS) for Training and education
        saved a lot of foreign exchange. As Sr. Manager, from 2012, he headed long-range missile programs, Agni-3 and
        Agni-5 as a quality control head at the center for Advanced systems (A DRDO Establishment). He led the most
        critical testing groups of the Agni missiles. Attain the complete self-sufficiency in electrical assembly and
        testing of the state-of-the-art Missiles assembly in line with DRDO Teams. He optimized the mission-critical
        adaptive test procedures and techniques for speedup and timely completion in the assembly line for Long Range
        Agni-5 missile production
        <br>
        <br>
        He holds the distinction of being inducted as Board of Governors (BoG) member as Industrialist Member at JNTU
        Hyderabad. He is a Fellow of the Instrument Society of India, Sensors Research Society (DRDO), a Life member of
        ISTE, and many other Academies and Scientific societies in the country. Dr. Chandrasekhar is invitee and key
        note speaker in several prestigious national and international invitations for Invited Talks and Chair Person,
        which includes the Technical University Berlin, Germany, Indian Institute of Science, IIT Delhi, BARC, and
        Central Electronics Engineering Institute (CEERI) for Engineering Excellence. He is an active BoS member and
        research super wiser of OU, JNTUH, SKU-Ananthpur, RU-Kurnool, and MGR Univ. Chennai. He has more than 20 years
        of combined University teaching, research, and R&D management experience. He has published around 45 research
        papers in International & National Journals and Conferences. He received few “Best Paper Awards” for the
        research work presented at TU, Berlin on Speech Recognition in 1992 from Vice-Chancellor Amravati University,
        and from Vice-Chancellor of SK University in 2006 for his contribution to continuing training on Embedded
        Systems and VLSI in the Universities.
